I write because there is no
one left in my life who knew me before I knew myself.

I write because I can talk to
the paper and not be interrupted or misunderstood or frozen mid-sentence by a
quizzical stare from a listener's eyes.

I write because I can't (nor
would you want to watch me) sing or dance or paint or sculpt or provide
anything else of artistic value to the universe other than what I can create
with my paper and pen.

I write because my days are
numbered; I have less days to live than I have already lived, and the
abstraction of mortality is waning, replaced by the very concreteness of
careening years.

I write because I kept my
mouth shut for too many years of my life. I write because I could exorcise the
ghosts of the past, the goblins of the present, the amorphous fears of the
future wielding a cheap plastic-barreled pen and a college-ruled notebook.

I write because words spoken
are swallowed by time. Words written are meals cooked today for a banquet to be
held later. I write because I have lived an unexpected life and the
surprises--both full of dread and full of awe--would otherwise drift uncharted.

I write because I want my
children to know me, not mother me or wife me, or sister me, or aunt me, or
grandmother me. But Christa Me. The deep and the shallow places. I want them to
have access to bits of my soul, perhaps slices of me that they may not hunger
for until I am no longer here to feed them.

I write because, in doing so,
I shape the memories, give them words that will be my eternal life breaths.
